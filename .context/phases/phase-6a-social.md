## Architecture Decisions

### Client/Server Separation
**Problem**: Next.js 15 build errors with server-side imports in client components
**Solution**: 
- Created separate `-server.ts` files for all server-side operations
- Client libraries use `createClient()` only
- Server libraries use `createServerClient()` with proper async handling
- Clean separation eliminates build issues

### Revenue-First Design
**Strategy**: Prioritize affiliate revenue over direct sales
- 9% commission structure across all partnerships
- Contextual integration at key user journey points
- UTM tracking for full attribution chain
- Revenue analytics dashboard ready

### Engagement Mechanics
**Gamification Approach**:
- Achievement-driven progression (not just points)
- Social validation through follow system
- Content quality through comment requirements
- Weekly engagement via email automation

## Metrics & Success Criteria

### Build Metrics
```bash
‚úÖ Build Success: 40 pages, 33 API routes
