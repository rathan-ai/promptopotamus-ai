### Security Review Summary

**Overall Posture:**

The application has a strong security foundation. It correctly uses Supabase for authentication and has good authorization checks in place. However, there are several critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, particularly in the quiz and payment functionalities.

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Quiz Cheating:** The biggest vulnerability is in the quiz functionality. The correct answers are sent to the client, making it trivial to cheat. This needs to be fixed by implementing a server-side quiz management system.
2.  **Payment Bypass in Quiz Attempts:** The `purchase-attempts` endpoint allows users to get more quiz attempts without paying. This needs to be integrated with a payment provider.

**High-Priority Recommendations:**

1.  **Fix Quiz Vulnerability:** Refactor the quiz functionality to be server-driven. The server should manage the quiz session and never send the correct answers to the client.
2.  **Fix Payment Bypass:** Integrate the `purchase-attempts` endpoint with a payment provider.
3.  **Centralize Admin Check:** Create a single, reusable `isAdmin` function to avoid code duplication and ensure consistent authorization logic.
4.  **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:** Use a library like `zod` to validate all user-supplied data in API routes. Sanitize all user-generated content to prevent stored XSS attacks.
5.  **Secure API Key Comparison:** Use a constant-time comparison function when checking the email API key to prevent timing attacks.

**Medium-Priority Recommendations:**

1.  **Simplify Payment Metadata Handling:** Refactor the payment confirmation logic to use a `purchase_attempts` table. This will make the process more robust and less dependent on the payment provider's data structure.
2.  **Add Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive API endpoints, especially those that create content or send emails.
3.  **Run `npm audit`:** Run `npm audit` to get a complete picture of any vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
