# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

## PayPal Credentials Compromised

Your PayPal API credentials were accidentally exposed in this development session:

- **Client ID**: AYrHZnmEgIk1APPXYLpDfkuBncE1hMSZivrLdbSVCBKAzo3oknSoqt5uF9wrr1wGJe38LTKmf6hWSv9U
- **Client Secret**: EI6xEDZtLrbEN-EB0ue1ywdMDGI6g1KUaoVTmRI0SYEy_BjJUF8_C51F3kWewI_pu0vgRapQ-40eplZx

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. Revoke Current Credentials (DO THIS NOW!)
1. Log into [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications)
2. Find your application with the exposed Client ID
3. **Delete/Revoke the current credentials immediately**
4. Generate new PayPal API credentials

### 2. Update Your Environment
1. Copy the new credentials to `.env.local`
2. Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`
3. Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in .gitignore)

### 3. Security Best Practices Going Forward
- ‚úÖ **NEVER share API secrets** in chat, email, or any public forum
- ‚úÖ **Use environment variables** for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Rotate credentials regularly**
- ‚úÖ **Monitor your PayPal account** for unauthorized transactions

## üõ°Ô∏è What We Fixed:

- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded secrets from source code
- ‚úÖ Ensured `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Updated payment adapter to use environment variables
- ‚úÖ Created `.env.example` template for secure setup

## üìß Next Steps:

1. **Revoke the exposed credentials immediately**
2. **Generate new PayPal API credentials**
3. **Update `.env.local` with new credentials**
4. **Test the payment system with new credentials**
5. **Delete this file after completing security steps**
