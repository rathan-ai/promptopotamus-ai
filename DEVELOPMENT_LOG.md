# Promptopotamus Development Log

## Project Overview
**Project**: Promptopotamus - AI Prompt Certification & Smart Prompts Marketplace Platform

## Core Platform Features

### 🎓 Certification System
- **3-Level Sequential Progression**: L1 (Promptling) → L2 (Promptosaur) → L3 (Promptopotamus)
- **Attempt Management**: 3 free attempts per level, purchase more or 9-day cooldown
- **Certificate Validity**: 6 months expiry with renewal system
- **Failure Cascade**: 3 consecutive failures drops user to previous level
- **Prerequisites**: Must complete previous level before advancing
- **Company Branding**: All certificates show "Created by Innorag Technologies Private Limited"

### 🏪 Smart Prompts Marketplace
- **Certification Gated**: Only users with valid certificates can sell prompts
- **Three Complexity Levels**:
  - **Simple Templates**: Basic variable substitution (`{variable}`)
  - **Smart Templates**: Conditional logic, context-aware features
  - **Recipes**: Multi-step processes with AI optimization
- **Monetization**: Revenue sharing (70-85% seller, 15-30% platform)
- **Purchase System**: Free and paid prompts with Stripe integration

### 💳 Business Model
- **Subscription Tiers**: Free, Pro ($9.99/mo), Premium ($19.99/mo)
- **Attempt Purchases**: Buy additional certification attempts
- **Marketplace Commission**: Variable based on seller subscription tier
- **Certification Requirements**: Drives subscription upgrades

## Development Timeline

### 2025-01-22 12:00 - Initial Analysis & Planning
**Commit**: `657e7c3` - Fix TypeScript error in admin users API
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Context**: User requested prompt recipe marketplace feature integration with existing certification system.

**Analysis Completed**:
- Reviewed existing certification system (3 attempts, 9-day cooldown, 6-month expiry)
- Identified missing sequential level progression (L1→L2→L3)
- Planned unified "Smart Prompts" system combining templates and recipes
- Designed certification-gated marketplace concept

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Unified approach: Templates + Recipes = "Smart Prompts" with complexity levels
- Marketplace access requires valid certification (any level)
- Sequential progression enforcement needed
- Company branding addition to certificates

### 2025-01-22 15:30 - Phase 1: Enhanced Certification System
**Commit**: `e623d8a` - Implement Phase 1: Enhanced certification system and Smart Prompts marketplace foundation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Backend Implementation**:

#### Certification Enhancements
- ✅ Added company branding to `CertificateDisplay.tsx`
- ✅ Created `/src/lib/certification.ts` utility library
- ✅ Enhanced `/src/app/api/quiz/status/[level]/route.ts` with:
  - Sequential level prerequisite checking
  - Failure cascade logic (3 failures → drop to previous level)
  - Comprehensive eligibility validation

#### Smart Prompts Marketplace Backend
- ✅ Database schema design: `migrations/003_create_smart_prompts.sql`
- ✅ Extended `saved_prompts` table with marketplace fields
- ✅ Created supporting tables: `smart_prompt_purchases`, `smart_prompt_reviews`, `user_prompt_collections`
- ✅ Implemented Row Level Security policies
- ✅ Built API endpoints:
  - `/src/app/api/smart-prompts/route.ts` - CRUD operations
  - `/src/app/api/smart-prompts/purchase/route.ts` - Purchase handling
  - `/src/app/api/smart-prompts/my-prompts/route.ts` - User prompts management

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Certification gating for marketplace access
- Three complexity levels (Simple, Smart, Recipe)
- Purchase system with Stripe integration
- User collections and analytics
- Comprehensive certification flow validation

**Business Logic**:
- Only certified users can create marketplace prompts
- Sequential progression: L1→L2→L3 with prerequisite enforcement
- Failure cascade: 3 consecutive failures drops to previous level
- Certificate expiry after 6 months with renewal flow

### 2025-01-22 16:00 - SQL Syntax Fix
**Commit**: `023fe11` - Fix SQL syntax for RLS policies in smart prompts migration
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Issue Fixed**: PostgreSQL doesn't support `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS` syntax
**Solution**: Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before each policy creation

**Migration Ready**: `migrations/003_create_smart_prompts.sql` successfully executed in Supabase

## Architecture Overview

### Database Schema
```
saved_prompts (extended)
├── Basic fields: id, title, description, prompt_text, user_id
├── Marketplace: is_marketplace, is_public, price, rating_*
├── Smart features: complexity_level, variables, recipe_steps
└── Metadata: tags, category, difficulty_level, use_cases

smart_prompt_purchases
├── Purchase tracking: prompt_id, buyer_id, seller_id
├── Payment: purchase_price, stripe_payment_intent_id
└── Timestamps: purchased_at

user_certificates (existing)
├── Certificate tracking: user_id, certificate_slug, credential_id
├── Validity: earned_at, expires_at
└── Prerequisites enforced via certification.ts

quiz_attempts (existing)
├── Attempt tracking: user_id, quiz_level, score, passed
├── Failure cascade counting via consecutive failures
└── Purchase attempt integration via profiles.purchased_attempts
```

### API Architecture
```
/api/quiz/status/[level] - Enhanced certification flow validation
